# ImageClassification
Training a deep neural network for image classification with the PyTorch library.

This code trains the model on the MNIST dataset for 10 epochs, using mini-batch gradient descent with a batch size of 64. The model is evaluated on the test set at the end of training and the accuracy is printed.

To run locally, install the necessary libraries by running 'pip install torch' and 'pip install torchvision' in the terminal.
