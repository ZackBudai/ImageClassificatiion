# ImageClassificatiion
Training a deep neural network for image classification with the PyTorch library.

This code trains the model on the MNIST dataset for 10 epochs, using mini-batch gradient descent with a batch size of 64. The model is evaluated on the test set at the end of training and the accuracy is printed.
